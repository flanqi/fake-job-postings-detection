# Fake Job Postings Detection

## Model Training

For model training via logistic regression, SVM, and CNN, open terminal and run command:
```bash
python main.py lr # logistic regression
python main.py svm # svm
python main.py cnn # cnn
python main.py multimodal --method svm # combinig text and meta features using svm
python main.py multimodal --method lr # combinig text and meta features using logistic regression
```
The best models for each architecture is saved into folder `output`. The best-performing model is `output/cnn_64_16_4.pickle`.

## API For Inference
For running the Flask App, please open two terminal windows, and run these commands separately:
```bash
python api.py
```
```bash
python client.py
```
By replacing text in json file in  "client.py", you can type in job descriptions and generate predicted probability.
For example, if you change `jd` to:
```python
jd = """The company is great, you will get a lot of money without working!!"""
```
It will return response like below:
```python
<Response [200]>
{'Job Description': 'The company is great, you will get a lot of money without working!!', 'Probability': '0.6580919781945342'}
```
